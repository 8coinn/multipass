What is multipass?
--------------------

Multipassd is a daemon that orchestrates the creation, management and
maintenance of virtual machine and associated ubuntu images to simplify
development on various platforms such as OSX and Windows 10

Dependencies
---------------------------------------
gRPC has to be built from source, pull all the required source submodules with:

    git submodule update --init --recursive
    mk-build-deps -s sudo -i

Building

Build and install gRPC first

    cd <multipass_root>/3rd-party/grpc
    make
    make install

Then multipass

    cd <multipass_root>
    mkdir build-multipass
    cd build-multipass
    cmake ../
    make
